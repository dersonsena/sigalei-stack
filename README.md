## Sigalei playground
We use this repository to test new thing that can be used in our main project in the future.

You can use it as a boilerplate to your projects if you like.

This is why we have a playground: https://medium.com/@sibelius/why-your-company-should-have-an-open-source-playground-4bb93068ce95
